		<TD><IMG SRC="promzy.jpg" WIDTH="200"><A HREF ="https://www.stpaulsmobile.net/ ">St. Paul's Link</A HREF> <P>During highschool, I wasn't as focused as I am now. I would get my work done, but it was always last minute. Procrastination was an attribute I simply could not rid of. In highschool, I was active in many clubs and sports. I was in many leadership organizations, sports, and tutorings. I also took leadership roles within my community to assure that I could be helpful and gain experience. I am glad of the things I achieved in highschool.</P></TD>

		<TD><IMG SRC ="freshzy.jpg" WIDTH="200"><A HREF ="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"> Games Developer Link </A><P>In the future I plan to be a games developer. I went to a Computer Science Camp with Google, and they introduced me to Computer Science. Ever since then I have found it interesting that I can control a computer and have it perform multiple actions. With this knowledge from Google, I want to one day create a game that becomes very successful and everyone wants to play. In due time this will be true.</P></TD>
